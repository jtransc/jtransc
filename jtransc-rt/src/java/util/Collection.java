 * {@code Collection} is the root of the collection hierarchy. It defines operations on
 * data collections and the behavior that they will have in all implementations
 * of {@code Collection}s.
 *
 * All direct or indirect implementations of {@code Collection} should implement at
 * least two constructors. One with no parameters which creates an empty
 * collection and one with a parameter of type {@code Collection}. This second
 * constructor can be used to create a collection of different type as the
 * initial collection but with the same elements. Implementations of {@code Collection}
 * cannot be forced to implement these two constructors but at least all
 * implementations under {@code java.util} do.
 *
 * Methods that change the content of a collection throw an
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException} if the underlying collection does not
 * support that operation, though it's not mandatory to throw such an {@code Exception}
 * in cases where the requested operation would not change the collection. In
 * these cases it's up to the implementation whether it throws an
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException} or not.
 *
 * Methods marked with (optional) can throw an
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException} if the underlying collection doesn't
 * support that method.
