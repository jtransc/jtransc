The JTransc Runtime Library includes the Regexodus library, that is a modified fork of Jregex:
This is a modified fork of JRegex, by Sergey A. Samokhodkin, meant to improve compatibility with
Android and GWT. This builds off Ed Ropple's work to make JRegex Maven-friendly. This fork started
with Ed Ropple's copy of jregex 1.2_01 (available on GitHub). In addition, portions of this code use
modified versions of the collections from Sebastiano Vigna's FastUtil library (in the regexodus.ds package,
CharCharMap and CharArrayList are derived from FastUtil).
