This is a miscellaneous test that was imported into the new-at-the-time
runtime test framework. The test is intended to exercise basic features,
and as such cannot be build on top of junit, since failure of such basic
features might disrupt junit.

This test covers the string inline-execute tests, and it done in a
looping manner to ensure that the tests are translated when a Jit is
active.
