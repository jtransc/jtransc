Class loaders allow code to "redefine" a given class, e.g. it's possible to
have multiple classes called "com.android.Blah" loaded simultaneously.  The
classes are distinct and must be treated as such.  This test exercises
some situations in which a VM that only checks the UTF-8 signatures could
mix things up.

This also tests a couple of situations in which an IllegalAccessException
is expected.
